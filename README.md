![Main Build Status](https://github.com/frankplow/mutff/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)
![Test Coverage](https://frankplow.github.io/mutff/badges/coverage.svg)

A small QuickTime file format (QTFF) library.

This library came out of a project I was doing where I needed a simple QTFF library to run on an ARM Cortex-M microcontroller.

## Examples
Here is an example of how to use the library to find the duration of a movie:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <mutff.h>

int movie_duration(FILE *file) {
  MuTFFMovieFile movie_file;
  int time_scale;
  int duration;

  if (mutff_read_movie_file(file, &movie_file) < 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to parse movie file.");
    return -1;
  }

  time_scale = movie_file.movie.movie_header.time_scale;
  duration = movie_file.movie.movie_header.duration / time_scale;

  return duration;
}
```

## Documentation
Documentation for the latest `main` is available on the [GitHub Pages site for this project](https://frankplow.github.io/mutff).

## Building from Source
To configure, while in the project root, run:
```
$ cmake -S . -B build
```
and to compile, again in the project root, run:
```
$ cmake --build
```

The project builds a static library by default. To build a shared library, pass `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1` during the configuration step. Other options supported by the project (and their defaults) are:
* `BUILD_TESTS` (`ON`)
* `BUILD_COVERAGE` (`OFF`)
* `BUILD_DOCS` (`OFF`)
